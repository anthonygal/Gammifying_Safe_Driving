# Hackathon UTC 2018: Gamfifying Safe Driving

This project consists in a small video game illustrating our idea that gamifying our driving experience may be an efficient incentive for us to adopt a safer and more ecological driving style.
This project is the result of our work for the Hackathon UTC 2018.
